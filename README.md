# 🚀 About Me

## Hi, I’m Ursula 👋

I’m actively learning and experimenting with **AI-assisted coding and data analysis**
to accelerate how product ideas move from concept to impact.

This GitHub captures how I’m building capability through training and hands-on practice,
using AI and code to improve feedback loops between customer insight,
design, and delivery.

## What I’m learning here
- Applying **AI-assisted workflows** to product discovery and decision-making
- Automating analysis of customer usage and feedback
- Prototyping internal tools and feature ideas to reduce friction and speed up learning

## Tools & focus areas
- PowerShell for automation and experimentation  
- KQL and Power BI for querying and understanding product data  
- Python (early-stage) for analysis and synthesis  
- Prompt design for turning raw inputs into insights and design artefacts

## Why this exists
The AI shift changes how product teams learn and deliver.
I’m deliberately developing hands-on skills to work faster,
validate earlier, and increase the leverage of product work.

## 💻 Programming Languages
As a Product Manager (started as an Engineer) here are some of the languages I developed through in the past and maintain a knowledge in. In the dynamic realm of cloud computing, I am gaining experience in leveraging leading cloud platforms and technologies to architect, deploy, and manage scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant systems. Delvered through the following frameworks.
